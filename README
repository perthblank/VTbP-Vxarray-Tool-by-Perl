Vxarray Tool by Perl

Description
	This program is designed to automate the vxarray process and deploy the vitual disks on the client machine 
	base on iSCSI, vxarray and Perl
	

Prepare
	0. A redhat 6.4 system
	if have not install vxarray
		1. Install vxarray and start SCST
		2. Replace /etc/scst.conf with scst.conf in this project folder
	end if
	3. Mount disk to vxdisk path (/vdisks default)
	4. Run 'perl backup.pl' 
	5. Install Expect for perl
		run cpan and enter 'install Net::SSH::Expect'
		i.e. cpan>install Net::SSH::Expect
	

Usage
(perl main.pl)
	-s disk_size
	-n disk_num
	[-t target_num] (default is 2, should be greater than 0)
	[	
	-c client_addr1,client_addr2...
	-u user1,user2...
	-p password1,password2... (use ',' to split and no space)
	] (if not specified, just do disk split)


Kernel files
    GlobalVar.pm # global variables include path and names of disk devices and targets
    ConfigSetter.pm # get and alter the config file
    DiskSpliter.pm # command to split disk and do refresh jobs
    Connector # connect the client and deploy disks
    main.pl # the entrance of this program

										 
Default configs
	vxdisk folder path: /vdisks/
	scst configuration file: /etc/scst.conf


Debug 
	All the path and name settings can be fount in GlobalVal.pm
	
	backup.pl # backup the original scst.conf file, for restore usage (to $scst_config_backup)
	restore.pl # used to restore the splited disk (with $vdisk_root_path prefix)
	check.sh # check current vxdisks

TODO
	Support Solaris client
	Record deployment history
	Support remove vdisk from client
	    delete the target from solaris
	    # stop product, installer -stop
	    # iscsiadm list target -S |grep -i target

FAQ
	Cannot mount disk?
		Check if the disk is in use, formatting it if there's still error
	fallocate: Operation not supported?
		Check if the disk format is ext4
	Error: cannot add target
		Check if target_driver is iscsi (in scst.conf)
	Multiple target set but cannot be treat as multi-path
		Make sure the content of each target is the same
	What's more
		iscsi did not support '_' well which should be avoid when naming target. Use '-' instead
